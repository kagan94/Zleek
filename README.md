How to get data from the image:
[list]
* 1. **Clear background**
Using openCV grab-cut
* 2. **Matlab Calculations** for extracting segments and classify different garments that a person is wearing.
We use conditional Random Fields (CRF) to recognize patterns in an image. With the segmented areaâ€™s we can classify different types of garments for example shirts, pants, belt, shoes etc. This is done with a library called Clothes Parsing. For full technical reference see.
* 3. Using the coordinates of the segments we **identify patterns and colors in each garment**.
